This plugin creates blog posts under any user specified categories, from Amazon.com search queries.

== Description ==
Creates blog posts from Amazon.com search results. Requires an AWS key pair (obtain from https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html). Has the ability to search any index for the given search keywords and add a blog post for each of the results.
Can customize:
       * The search index
       * Search Keywords
       * Maximum description length
       * The categories to which the posts should be added
       * The maximum number of posts to create

The styles of the post are hard coded as of now. I'll add a separate css for the styling of each of the elements when I get some time. To add affiliate tags to links to Amazon. please use the Amazon Affiliate Link Localizer plugin.
